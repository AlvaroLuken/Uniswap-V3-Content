## Investment Contract

In this exercise we're going to build an investment contract which allows a group of addresses to deposit DAI for an investment into an ERC20 token. Once all the DAI has been invested the owner of the contract can invest along a given `path` to an ERC20 token of their choice. After the investment is complete, they can move the funds back into DAI so that the shareholders can withdraw.
